If your trade is successful, you receive a $100 payout, so your profit will be $100 minus the money you paid to open the trade.  If your trade isn’t successful, you don’t receive a payout.

Risk is limited, but market access is not, with no pattern day trader rule and a wide range of contracts. Nadex is built for short-term trading – backed by innovative tech, the platform presents an abundance of opportunities for ambitious day traders. </p> <h2>An innovative trading platform for any device </h2> <p>Nadex lets you trade on any device so you can react to market movements and keep up the pace. </p> <p><b>Nadex for desktop: </b>Trade from your browser directly on the North American Derivatives Exchange™ (NADEX). You can <a href="https://platform.nadex.com/npwa/index#/login">log in</a> to the Nadex platform from a desktop or laptop computer – it will run on Mac, Windows, and Linux. </p> <p><b>NadexGO™ for mobile: </b>NadexGO is a progressive web app – you log in the same way you would on a desktop or laptop computer, but from your mobile. This means there’s no need to download anything, and any updates happen automatically. The web app is compatible with Android and iOS, so you can access the same markets and features on the go. It can easily be added to your home screen for speedy access. </p> <p>The Nadex platform is ideally suited to day trading <a href="../../products/binary-options/index.html">binary options</a>, as well as the other two Nadex products: <a href="../../products/knock-outs/index.html">knock-outs</a> and <a href="../../products/call-spread-contract/index.html">call spreads</a>. All three are limited-risk products with a built-in trading plan. With no pattern day trader rule, you can trade in and out of markets as you please.</p> <h3>Try trading anywhere, anytime with a Nadex demo account </h3> <p>Try Nadex for desktop and mobile with a <a href="../../demo/index.html">free demo account</a>. You’ll get $10,000 in virtual funds to try out day trading on our platform. </p> <h2>No pattern day trader rule </h2> <p>One of the key advantages of trading on Nadex is no pattern day trader rule. This means you can trade whenever the exchange is open, getting into and out of trades as you choose – all Nadex contracts allow you to close out early. You won’t be flagged as a pattern day trader (PDT) based on your Nadex account trading activity. This benefits you because: </p> <ul><li><p>You aren’t limited to fewer than four day trades within a five day period </p></li><li><p>You won’t have to hold $25,000 in your Nadex account (this is because you won’t be affected by PDT rules, and Nadex doesn’t offer margin accounts)</p></li></ul> <p>The regular trading hours for our platform are Sunday 6:00 p.m. - Friday 4:15 p.m. ET, giving you more flexibility as a day trader. Please note holidays can affect these hours, and trading is paused from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Monday through Thursday for end-of-day processing. </p> <h2>Meeting your need for speed: a platform designed for short-term trading</h2> <p><a href="../new-nadex-platform-switchover/index.html">The Nadex platform was recently updated</a>, offering faster load speeds and quicker order executions.

You decide whether a market is likely to be above a certain price, at a certain time. Trading a binary option is like asking a simple question: will this market be above this price at this time? If you think yes, you buy, and if you think no, you sell. Nadex Binary Options enable traders to predict the outcome of an underlying market’s movement. Learn more about <a href="../../learning/what-are-binary-options-and-how-do-they-work/index.html">how binary options work</a>. </p> <h2>How do binary options work?</h2> <p>There are three key elements that make up a binary option contract: </p> <ul><li><p>The underlying market. This is the market you choose to trade. </p></li><li><p>The strike price. The strike price is central to the binary option decision-making process – to place a trade, you must decide if you think the underlying market will be above or below the strike. </p></li><li><p>The expiration date and time. You can trade binary options lasting for up to one week, with durations as short as five minutes. </p></li></ul> <p>Learn more about <a href="../../learning/what-are-binary-options-and-how-do-they-work/index.html">how binary options work</a>. </p> <h2>Are binary options legal?</h2> <p>Yes, binary options are legal to trade with a regulated provider in the US. It’s not just legal to trade binary options in the US – it’s regulated, has low capital requirements, and is accessible to retail traders. Look out for CFTC regulation to make sure the exchange you are trading on has legal oversight to protect you against unscrupulous market practices. Additionally, ensure the exchange is based in the US and that you trade your own account. Learn more about <a href="../are-binary-options-legal-in-the-us/index.html">how binary options are regulated</a>. </p> <h2>Is binary options trading risky?</h2> <p>It can be! Here are some steps to follow so that you can trade binary options more securely: </p> <ul><li><p>Only trade with a CFTC regulated exchange. </p></li><li><p>Don’t engage with anybody who claims to be a broker, or who says they can trade your account for you.  </p></li><li><p>Trade your own account.  </p></li></ul> <p>Try trading binary options on a regulated exchange for free! The best way to trade more confidently is through practice on our <a href="../../demo/index.html">binary options demo account</a> with $10,000 in virtual funds. </p> <h2>How do binary traders make money?</h2> <p>Binary traders can make money by correctly predicting whether a market will be above a specific price at a specific time. At expiration, you either make a predefined profit or you lose the money you paid to open the trade. Binary options are priced between $0 and $100. Each contract will show you the maximum you could gain and the maximum you could lose. If your trade is successful, you receive a $100 payout, so your profit will be $100 minus the money you paid to open the trade.  If your trade isn’t successful, you don’t receive a payout. This means you lost your capital, but nothing else, because your risk is capped. </p> <h2>What&#39;s the difference between options and binary options?</h2> <p>Binary options are short-term, limited risk contracts with two possible outcomes at expiration – you either make a predefined profit or you lose the money you paid to open the trade. The payoff is fixed on either side of the strike price. Options, also called vanilla options, have a payout that is dependent on the difference of the strike price of the option and the price of the underlying asset on one side of the strike price while fixed on the other. Options can be complex, difficult to price, and have the potential for outsized profits or losses. </p> <h2>What&#39;s the minimum deposit for a binary options trade?</h2> <p>At Nadex, you can open a live account for free - that&#39;s right, no minimum deposit required. Binary trades at Nadex are priced between $0 and $100, excluding exchange fees. The cost to place a trade is always equal to the maximum risk, plus any trade fees, which is required to be in your account when the order is placed. Not ready for a live account?

Keep in mind, you should have strong risk management and utilize multiple strategies that adjust for different market conditions. </p> <p>Day trading can certainly be a career for many who have the discipline, tools, education, and keen understanding of their trading psychology and style. The best way to get started is with a <a href="../../demo/index.html">free demo account</a> to hone your skills and learn what products and markets best suit your day trading style.</p> <h2>How much do you need for day trading?</h2> <p>For most day traders in the US, the legal minimum balance required to day trade stocks is $25,000. This is known as the Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule. However, Nadex is exempt from the PDT Rule. Plus, you can open a live account for free - that&#39;s right, no minimum deposit required. The cost to place a trade is always equal to the maximum risk, plus any trade fees. Not ready for a live account?

A pattern day trader is a person who executes four or more trades over five business days and usually must follow the Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule. Nadex has <a href="../pattern-day-trader-rules-to-follow/index.html">no Pattern Day Trader Rule</a> and offers thousands of contracts with durations from five minutes to a week.
